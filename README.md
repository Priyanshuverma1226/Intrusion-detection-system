# Intrusion detection system

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a type of security system that monitors network traffic and alerts system administrators or security personnel when it detects suspicious or unauthorized activity. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source library of computer vision algorithms and tools that can be used for image processing, object detection, and tracking.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

```bash
pip install cvzone
```
```bash
pip install twilio
```

# Some specific applications of OpenCV in IDS include:

Traffic analysis: OpenCV can be used to extract features from network traffic data, such as packet size, protocol type, or time stamps, and use these features to train machine learning models for intrusion detection.

Video surveillance: OpenCV can be used for video analysis to detect intrusions in physical spaces, such as unauthorized access to a restricted area or suspicious behavior in a public space.

Face recognition: OpenCV can be used for facial recognition to identify individuals who are authorized to access a network or physical space and flag any attempts by unauthorized individuals.
